# polybar

My personal configuration for [polybar](https://polybar.github.io/)
I will do my best to comment the configuration file. Feel free to crib/steal this for your own personal use.

## Usage

Run `./install.sh` to link the configuration files to the proper location.

Run `./launch.sh` to start/re-start the process.
